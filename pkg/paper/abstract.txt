Beta Regression: Shaken, Stirred, Mixed, and Partitioned
Achim Zeileis, Francisco Cribari-Neto, Bettina Grün

The class of beta regression models is commonly used by practitioners
to model variables that assume values in the open standard unit
interval (0, 1). It is based on the assumption that the dependent
variable is beta-distributed with its mean and precision parameters
depending on some regressors. We explore various flavors of
parametrizations for the dependence of the response on the regressors.
To shake and stirr, either a single or double index model is employed
for mean and/or precision, i.e., the parameters are related to
potentially different sets of regressors through a linear predictor
plus link function(s). This approach naturally incorporates features
such as heteroskedasticity or skewness which are commonly observed in
data taking values in the standard unit interval, such as rates or
proportions. Furthermore, additional heterogeneity in the data can be
captured by mixing or partitioning: If covariates are available that
explain the heterogeneity, a model-based recursive partitioning
approach can be employed. If not, latent class regression is an
alternative. All flavors of models are implemented in the R package
betareg, leveraging the flexmix and party packages.
